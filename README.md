# Genotype-calling

This is an automated pipeline for quantitative genotype calling from next generation sequencing data.
It will deliver the most likely genotype for a sample based on genotype calls from sequencing. 
Base calls and qualities as well as the reference allele and respective frequencies must be entered by the user as well as the chromosome position and SNP ID.
This code will create a VCF file like table containing the most likely genotype for a sample.
